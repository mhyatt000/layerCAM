# Jittor and PyTorch implementation of [LayerCAM: Exploring Hierarchical Class Activation Maps for Localization](http://mftp.mmcheng.net/Papers/21TIP_LayerCAM.pdf)

To appear at IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 2021  

This paper aims to generate reliable class activation maps from different CNN layers. The class activation maps generated from the shallow layers of CNN tend to capture fine-grained object localization information, while the maps generated from the deep layers tend to generally locate the target objects. 

## Update

**`2022.3.19`**: The localization code is released [layercam_loc](https://github.com/PengtaoJiang/layercam_loc).  
**`2021.10.31`**: A simple colab tutorial implemented by frgfm [frgfm/notebooks](https://github.com/frgfm/notebooks).  
**`2021.8.13`**: Merged into [keisen/tf-keras-vis](https://github.com/keisen/tf-keras-vis).  
**`2021.7.14`**: Merged into [frgfm/torch-cam](https://github.com/frgfm/torch-cam).  
**`2021.7.12`**: Merged into [utkuozbulak/pytorch-cnn-visualizations](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-cnn-visualizations) (5.8K Stars).  
**`2021.7.10`**: Merged into [jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam](https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam) (2.9K Stars).


## Run 

```
python test.py --img_path=images/ILSVRC2012_val_00000057.JPEG(or your own image path)
```

## Some issues

For those layers that are followed by a layer (max pooling in vgg or conv with stride > 1 in resnet), the cam visualizations usually have grid effect. 
This issue comes from the gradient backward. There are two ways to avoid this issue.   
1. I usually choose the nearby layers for visualization. For example, pool4 instead of conv3_3 in vgg16, or model.layer3[-2] instead of model.layer3[-1] in ResNet. 
2. Another choice is to upsample the following layer's gradient, for example, Up(pool4's gradient) * conv3_3's activation. 
3. Besides, we also found that larger input will obtain more fine-grained cam visualization for lower layers.
